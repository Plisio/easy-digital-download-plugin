= How it works - example =

1. An item in the store costs 100 euro.
2. A customer wants to buy the item and selects to pay with Bitcoin.
3. An invoice is generated and, according to the current exchange rate, the price is 10,000 euro per bitcoin, so the customer has to pay 0.01 bitcoins.
4. Once the invoice is paid, the merchant gets a notification and is credited 99,5 euro (100 euro minus our 0.5% flat fee).
